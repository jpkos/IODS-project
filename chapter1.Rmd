## About me

I have used *R and RStudio* quite a lot in my work. I'm familiar with ***Git and Github***, but have not become 'fluent' with them yet -- in fact, using them has always felt a bit cumbersome. I hope this course will help me get better with using Git/GitHub.

I heard about the course from my supervisor and department mailing list.
